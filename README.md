# E-Bay-Perfume-Market-Insights
## Project Overview
This project aims to explore market insights for perfumes sold on the E-Bay platform, and the entire analysis process is carried out through the following stages:

Data Cleaning and Analysis with Python
The dataset is cleaned and prepared using Python (pandas, numpy) to remove duplicate data, handle missing values, and perform in-depth analysis.

Visualization and Interactive Dashboard with Tableau
After the data is cleaned, data exploration and the creation of an interactive dashboard are performed using Tableau. This dashboard displays key information such as the countries with the highest number of sellers, best-selling product categories, as well as price trends and buyer preferences based on gender and location.

This project provides a comprehensive overview of the perfume market conditions on the E-Bay platform and can serve as a reference for data-driven business decision-making.

## Data Source
The dataset was obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kanchana1990/perfume-e-commerce-dataset-2024

## Background
The perfume industry continues to grow along with increasing consumer preferences for unique and high-quality fragrances. The Perfume E-Commerce Dataset 2024 offers an in-depth view of global perfume market trends, with 2,000 perfume listings from eBay divided into two categories: men's and women's perfumes. This dataset reflects the dynamics of the perfume industry, including pricing, availability, and geographic distribution in the e-commerce realm.

In Indonesia, demand for local perfumes is rising, especially due to the unique aromas that reflect the culture and distinctive characteristics of the Nusantara region. However, local brands still face significant challenges competing with imported niche perfumes that already have more established markets. This competition drives the domestic perfume industry to continuously innovate by creating products that not only appeal to domestic consumers but also have competitive power at the global level.

One successful example of a local brand is Alchemist, which has become a popular choice among Malaysian tourists visiting Indonesia. This phenomenon shows that local perfumes have great potential to grow in the international market. By understanding global trends through e-commerce data and applying innovative product development strategies, Indonesian perfume brands can expand their reach and increase their competitiveness in the global fragrance industry.

## Problem Statement & Objective
Enhance the competitiveness of local perfumes in the global market by analyzing sales trends, customer segmentation, and pricing parameters to establish competitive strategies, targeting a 20% sales increase within 12 months, expansion into three countries within two years, and launching two new variants within one year, aligned with foreign tourist trends as an expansion opportunity, with analysis implementation in the second quarter.

Objective: Analyze market data related to the fragrance industry, consumer trends, and customer preferences, as well as understand market movements in the beauty industry. Use the data to provide recommendations for marketing strategies and product development.

## Conclusion & Recommendations
- New Variants: It is necessary to launch premium products in the Eau De Parfum and Eau De Toilette categories, with supporting products in Eau De Cologne.
- Current Sales Trends: Besides optimizing pricing around USD 43, driving factors such as promotions or seasonal trends should be considered; therefore, optimizing campaign strategies is recommended.
- Outlet Store: Considering current international regulations and significant demand in Asia, opening new branches in China and Hong Kong can be initiated.
